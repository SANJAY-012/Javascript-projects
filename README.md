Weather Forecast Website,
This repository contains the code for a weather forecast website created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Description
The weather forecast website provides users with up-to-date weather information for different locations. It utilizes HTML for structuring the content, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for fetching and displaying weather data from an API.

The website features a user-friendly interface with a search bar where users can enter the name of a location to get the weather forecast. Upon entering a location, the website retrieves data from a weather API and displays the current weather conditions, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a five-day forecast. The forecast includes the date, weather icon, temperature, and a brief description of the weather.
